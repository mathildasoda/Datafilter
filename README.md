# Datafilter
Creating a julia datafilter which takes in a number amount of .csv files and output the desired aspect of the input files.

As of now, I'm working according to the mock data files whose name are in my .gitignore. Currently, I have no intention of uploading the data files due to its copyright issue. This problem would be resolved later. However, if you are interested in what the datafile look like, I have left results of my Jupyter Notebook checkpoints on here. I mainly use Jupyter Notebook to test my codes, it makes things easier.
