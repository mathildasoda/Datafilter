# Datafilter
Creating a julia datafilter which takes in a number amount of .csv files and output the desired aspect of the input files

As of now, I'm working according to the mock data files whose name are in my .gitignore. Currently, I have no intention of uploading the data files due to its copyright issue. This problem would be resolved later. 

Mock data files names are in .gitignore
